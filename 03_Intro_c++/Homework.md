3️⃣ Day 3/180 => Introduction to c++

    🟢 Print number:

        ✅ Two numbers are given, print their product
        ✅ Two numbers are given a and b, print a-b
        ✅ Print 6*3 in output, don’t print 18, just 6*3 should be in the output screen.
        ✅ If we have only 4 bits, How 3 and -6 will be written in 4 bits.
        ✅ If we have only 5 bits, How 13 and -16 will be written in 5 bits.
